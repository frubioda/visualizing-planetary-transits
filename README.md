visualizing planetary transits

Every once in a rare while, one of our inner planets transits across the face of the Sun. On May 9, 2016, Mercury [made such a transit](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mercury-takes-a-stroll-across-the-sun/). This notebook creates a composite image of Mercury's transit as observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on NASA's [Solar Dynamics Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
